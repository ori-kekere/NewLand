1. Create a new field user model 'is_verified' the default should be set to 'false'
2. When the user logs in check if 'is_verified' = true, if that is true the user should be able to log in; if 'is_verified' = false tell the user that they need to verify their account by clicking the link sent to their registered email address
3. Create a new table called 'verification_links' there should be coloums 'user_email', 'expiration_date', 'user_id', 'is_used' and 'is_used'
4. Create a function in the user model that will create a new verification link and save it to the database when a user registers
4. a: set expiration_date to 2 days from the current date
4. b: set is_used to false
5. Create a page called 'activate-account' that accepts parameters 'email' and 'id'
5. a: When a user navigates to the 'activate-account' page check if the 'is_used' is true, if it is true then tell the user that their account has already been verified
5. b: If 'is_used' is false then check if the 'expiration_date' is past, if it is past then tell the user that their account has expired
5. c: If 'is_used' is false and the 'expiration_date' is not past then update the 'is_used'. 
5. d: Then update the 'is_verified' to true in the user model
